    - Error return value of .((os\.)?std(out|err)\..*|.*Close|.*Flush|os\.Remove(All)?|.*printf?|os\.(Un)?Setenv). is not checked
    # golint: False positive when tests are defined in package 'test'
    - func name will be used as test\.Test.* by other packages, and that stutters; consider calling this
    # govet: Common false positives
    - (possible misuse of unsafe.Pointer|should have signature)
    # staticcheck: Developers tend to write in C-style with an explicit 'break' in a 'switch', so it's ok to ignore
    - ineffective break statement. Did you mean to break out of the outer loop
    # gosec: Too many false-positives on 'unsafe' usage
    - Use of unsafe calls should be audited
    # gosec: Too many false-positives for parametrized shell calls
    - Subprocess launch(ed with variable|ing should be audited)
